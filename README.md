# Django Blog Example
## Back End (Django/PostgreSQL)

**Currently Deactivated**

Example of a Django backend (PostgreSQL) for students interested in the difference between Django / Flask or Django / Node.

Basic blog hooked up to PostgreSQL (for data storage) and AWS S3 (for image storage). Used in tandem with a React Front End (not uploaded here since the focus of the lesson is typically the backend and I've got a million-and-five React projects).
